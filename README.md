none

It is about simulation of car motion system. The car does uniformly accelerated motion.
Two matlab codes are included. One is about prediction and correction from t0 to t1 by fusing the model and senor data. Another one is simulation of a period involving many time points.

Generally, when we can measure something and know some prior knowledge of a system, Kalman filter is a good approach to include this prior knowledge into the raw measurements and reach a better prediction.
